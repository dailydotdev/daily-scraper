The service uses [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer), a headless Chrome, to scrape webpages.
Currently, its only purpose is to provide information when a user suggests a new source.
The scraper can find the icon, RSS feed, name, and other relevant information for every page.

## Stack

* Node v16.20.0 (a `.nvmrc` is presented for [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) users).

* NPM for managing dependencies.

* Fastify as the web framework

## Project structure

* `__tests__` - There you can find all the tests and fixtures. Tests are written using `jest`.

* `helm` - The home of the service helm chart for easily deploying it to Kubernetes.

* `src` - This is obviously the place where you can find the source files.

  * `scrape` - Stores many utility functions to scrape information from a webpage.

## Local environment

Daily Scraper requires nothing to run. It doesn't need any database or a service.

[.env](.env) is used to set the required environment variables. It is loaded automatically by the project.

Finally, run `npm run dev` to run the service and listen on port `5001`.
